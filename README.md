# Automatidata-project
In this project, the Automatidata team is developing a multiple linear regression model to predict taxi fares for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (NYC TLC). This model will use a dataset collected over the past year to generate accurate fare predictions, aimed at helping the client enhance their fare estimation processes.
